1. A policy is a function which maps ____ to ____.
   => States to probability distributions over actions.
   
2. The term “backup” most closely resembles the term ___ in meaning.
   => Update
   
3. At least one deterministic optimal policy exists in every Markov decision process.
   => True
   Let’s say there is a policy \pi_1π 
1
​	
  which does well in some states, while policy \pi_2π 
2
​	
  does well in others. We could combine these policies into a third policy \pi_3π 
3
​	
 , which always chooses actions according to whichever of policy \pi_1π 
1
​	
  and \pi_2π 
2
​	
  has the highest value in the current state. \pi_3π 
3
​	
  will necessarily have a value greater than or equal to both \pi_1π 
1
​	
  and \pi_2π 
2
​	
  in every state! So we will never have a situation where doing well in one state requires sacrificing value in another. Because of this, there always exists some policy which is best in every state. This is of course only an informal argument, but there is in fact a rigorous proof showing that there must always exist at least one optimal deterministic policy.
